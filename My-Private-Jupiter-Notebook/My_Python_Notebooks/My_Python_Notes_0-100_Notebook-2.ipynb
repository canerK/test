(We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).\n",

Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.\n",

    "For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",

    "Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",

    "Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\n",
    "\n",
