    "If you already familiar with Matlab/Octave, one of the main similarities between Python and Matlab/Octave is that they both work in the same way i.e. like a calculator does. For instance, let's see what we mean on some numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3.1 (above) Regarding the observation is that this symbol \" '>>>> \" means that there are some numbers are provided as input to be summed, more specifically, \"2+2\" is the input then hit to [Enter] that returns 4.!\n",

    "1.6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3.1.5: Division (/), (%) reminder and (//) operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:\n",

    "#### Example 3.1.9:  Use Sign (=) operator and parameters to continue calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:\n",

    "\n",
    "'>>> price = 100.50\n",

    "'>>> price + _\n",
    "\n",
    "    113.0625\n",
    "\n",
    "'>>> round(_, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    113.06\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).\n",
